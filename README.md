# scheduler

## Description
  - This is a developed third-party API, work day scheduler. This app will be a simple calendar app that will allow you to save events/appointments/meetings for each hour of a typical working day. The purpose of this app is to be able to add important events/appointments/meetings to my daily planner. This will ensure I am able to manage my time to the best of my ability.

    * I have added another skill to my tool box, Day.js. 

  ### What are the aspects of my website?
    - When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    - When I scroll down I am shown timeblocks for traditional buisness hours (9-5pm)
    - When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or furture.
    - When I click into a timeblock, I can enter and event.
    - When I click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
    - When I refresh the page the saved events remain.

  ### - What you are expected to see on your screen
